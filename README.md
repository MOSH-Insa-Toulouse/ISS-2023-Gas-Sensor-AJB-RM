# Introduction
The objective of this project is to integrate a gas sensor that we made ourselves and send its data over a Lora network to a dashboard to see and analyses the values.

# Initiation to Electronics and Arduino programming
As we both come from a computer science background (4IR-SC), we used the first labs as an introduction to Arduino and Kicad. We tested some small project from simply making a LED from an Arduino blinck to collecting data sent by a Nunchunck (A nintendo WII controller). We also designed an android application able to communicate and interact with an arduino.


These first session were really usefull to understand the basics of Arduino programming and electronics. These small project were a good introduction to the real project of this course.

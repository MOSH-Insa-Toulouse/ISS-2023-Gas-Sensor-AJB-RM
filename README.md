# Introduction
The objective of this project is to integrate a gas sensor that we made ourselves during a training period at AIME (Atelier Interuniversitaire de Micro Electronique) and send its data over a Lora network to a dashboard to see and analyse the values.

# Initiation to Electronics and Arduino programming
As we both come from a computer science background (4IR-SC), we used the first labs as an introduction to Arduino and Kicad. We tested some small projects from simply making a LED from an Arduino blink to collecting data sent by a Nunchunck (A nintendo WII controller). We also designed an android application able to communicate and interact with an arduino.

These first sessions were really usefull to understand the basics of Arduino programming and electronics. These small projects were a good introduction to the real project of this course.
